#Statement of Work

#Project Overview
Philadelphia Orchestra is in the process of developing an e-mail template for their CEO’s e-mail communication to a group of Philadelphia Orchestra constituents. This email must comply with branding and be compatible with a variety of email applications. The email template will also support namespaces from segmented data from the company’s CRM.

#Project Steps
Before creating this email template, I would do some initial project discovery with stakeholders to better understand the content and the segment of data I would be working with.  In addition I would need to identify any product features, constraints or technical limitations with the CRM. 

I would start this process by gathering the content and assets used for the email. Using Ux-pin I would prototype an email layout with the actual content to establish a design that could be presented to company stakeholders. I usually would start with a couple different options. I would want to understand the immediate calls to action. Is it to fundraise? Increase awareness? 

Once a design direction is approved, I would start building the email template. As soon as the email template is built the email can be tested using Litmus, until the email is compliant with the major email clients and devices have been solved for.

I think it is important to outline that once the email is ready for distribution, the work is just beginning. In order to achieve the desired conversion optimization rate, I would suggest doing a proper A / B test to monitor metrics such as your click-through rate, open rate and bounce rates on your landing pages.
